###Brief Summary
It's the design for a Reduced Instruction Set Computer called BETA. It is a CPU that performs functions like basic arithmetics, branch, and exception handling. This is the course project for MIT computational structure course.

Great project. An often frustration 6 hours with a great ending!
Certainly the design is not optimized, partly because Jade simulator has some obscure syntax rules and the manual is not very exhaustive, patly because it's too frsutrating to be perfectionist on this one.

JADE_SAVED_MODULES.TXT is the local storage file for Jade. Paste it with the browser console and Jade will load my design.
